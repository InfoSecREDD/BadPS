# BadPS
BadUSB Payload Development Launcher

This tool was created to give people the ability to develop BadUSB payloads without plugging in a device, loading the device, loading the dev payload, then executing on device. This allows the BadUSB script to be simulated as if a BadUSB Device was running the attack. More features will be added later. This project is meant for development and education purposes only.
